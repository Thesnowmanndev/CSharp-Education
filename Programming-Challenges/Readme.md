# Programming Challenges

This folder contains all programming challenges I have programmed using the C# language. These programming challenges are from Tony Gaddis's [Starting out with Java: From Control Structures through Objects](https://www.amazon.com/Starting-Out-Java-Structures-Computer/dp/0134802217/ref=sr_1_3?crid=11ANLMEEU8F2M&keywords=Tony+Gaddis&qid=1683395849&sprefix=tony+gaddi%2Caps%2C100&sr=8-3&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.f5122f16-c3e8-4386-bf32-63e904010ad0) book. Just implemented with the C# book.
