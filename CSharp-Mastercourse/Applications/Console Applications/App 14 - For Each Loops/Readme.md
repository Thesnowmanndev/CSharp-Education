# For Each Loops

Looping in a programming language is a way to execute a statement or a set of statements multiple numbers of times depending on the result of a condition to be evaluated. The resulting condition should be true to execute statements within loops. The foreach loop is used to iterate over the elements of the collection. The collection may be an array or a list. It executes for each element present in the array.

- It is necessary to enclose the statements of foreach loop in curly braces {}.
- Instead of declaring and initializing a loop counter variable, you declare a variable that is the same type as the base type of the array, followed by a colon, which is then followed by the array name.
- In the loop body, you can use the loop variable you created rather than using an indexed array element.
